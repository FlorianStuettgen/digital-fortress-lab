### **Compute & Storage**

<details open>
  
<summary><em> </em></summary>  

- **Dell R710** runs **Qubes OS**, isolating all workloads into AppVMs for management, lab experimentation, honeypots, and guest domains.  
- **EqualLogic FS7610 + Avid 18-bay chassis** run **Proxmox VE**, hosting storage-heavy VMs, orchestration, and containerized workloads.  
- This dual-hypervisor approach separates **compute isolation (Qubes OS)** from **storage orchestration (Proxmox VE)**, maximizing security while maintaining performance.

</details>


### **Network & OOB Management**

<details open>
  
<summary><em> </em></summary>  
  
- Dell X1052P handles all VLAN segmentation and high-throughput traffic.  
- Patch panels and structured cabling maintain clean, redundant connectivity.  
- Out-of-band access via OpenGear CM4148 and Rack KVM ensures management during network outages.

</details>


### **Security & SOC Node**

<details open>
  
<summary><em> </em></summary>  
  
- Panasonic Toughbook running SELKS + Suricata provides real-time monitoring, intrusion detection, and ELK integration.  
- SaltStack orchestrates dynamic VM placement, firewall adjustments, and honeypot activation across both Proxmox and Qubes OS domains.  
- LLM-driven analytics interpret logs, anticipate threats, and reconfigure the network in real time.

</div>

- **Proxmox VE** runs on EqualLogic + Avid hardware to host storage and containerized services.  
- **Qubes OS** runs on R710 to isolate experimental workloads securely.  
- SaltStack coordinates VM orchestration across Proxmox and Qubes domains, ensuring dynamic security responses and workload placement.  
- AppVMs in Qubes separate workloads by trust: management, lab, guest, and honeypot domains.  
- LLM-driven analytics analyze logs and adjust the environment automatically to mitigate threats and optimize performance.
