\# Services and Virtual Machines



This document will map key services in the lab to the Proxmox VMs and physical hosts that provide them. It is a work in progress.



Planned sections:



\- Core infrastructure services (directory, DNS, time, etc.)

\- Security services (logging, Suricata/SELKS, supporting databases)

\- Application / lab workloads

\- Honeypot workloads
