\# Future Roadmap



This document tracks planned improvements and experiments for the Digital Fortress Lab.



Examples of future work:



\- Additional network diagrams and service maps

\- More detailed firewall policy examples in `infra/`

\- Automation for backups and routine checks

\- Expanded honeypot scenarios and analysis tooling

\- Integration with new hardware or external labs



Items are maintained as ideas rather than commitments and may change as the environment evolves.
